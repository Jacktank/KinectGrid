This libraries are required to run KinectGrid. 
Onion requires the manuall installation by you.
The other ones are already included and
noted for the sake of completeness.

======= 1) Onion (Webserver) ========================
	Install the onion library in the lib folder
	of KinectGrid. Run the following command to 
	do that:

	cd 3rdparty
	git clone https://github.com/davidmoreno/onion.git
	cd onion
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../../lib/onion ..
	make
	make install

	Remarks:
	If you want install the lib on your system omit the above CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX argument.

	Disable compiling of examples and tests (i.e just
	comment the last two lines in CMakeLists.txt) if make causes trouble.

	Known Problems: (If you not edit CMakeLists.txt)
	• make throws
		'onion/src/onion/poller.c:453: error: 
		 ignoring return value of ‘write’, declared with attribute warn_unused_result'
		 Solution: Remove -Werror from CMAKE_C_FLAGS in CMakeLists.txt

	• make stops at "[ 67%] Generating fileserver_html.c" with 100% CPU usage.
	If you compile on ARM architecture the solution can found here:
