Known Problems:
 Websocket did not work and terminal prints out
  '[ERROR onion.c:385] Error accepting connection: Function not implemented'

 Solution: Probably your kernel did not support accept4(...). 
 Add #undef SOCK_CLOEXEC just before the the #ifndef SOCK_CLOEXEC at 3rdparty/onion/src/onion.c:193
 and recompile & reinstall the library.
