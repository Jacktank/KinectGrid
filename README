Linux clone of MultiMultiTouchTouch aka Space Palette of Tim Thompson ( http://spacepalette.com ).

Use your Kinect to define 'virtual' touchpads and 
send touch information in TUIO format. Look at the
wiki page for some screenshots.

Even on ARM platforms (I.e. beagleboard) are 30 fps reached.


Known Problems:
 Kinect sensor did not shutdown if KinectGrid terminated with Ctrl+C.
 Solution: Press ESC in the application window.


 Websocket did not work and terminal prints out
  '[ERROR onion.c:385] Error accepting connection: Function not implemented'

 Solution: Probably your kernel did not support accept4(...). 
 Add #undef SOCK_CLOEXEC just before the the #ifndef SOCK_CLOEXEC at 3rdparty/onion/src/onion.c:193
 and recompile & reinstall the library.
